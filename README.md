# Jennilees Tech Blog - Match an Email Regex

This tutorial is to explain the structure, components and purpose of regular expressions. A regular expression is sequence of characters that defines a pattern similar to a cipher. Like a regular expression and cipher uses numbers or symbols to represent different letters, much like a regular expression that uses the character sequence to define a pattern. 

## Summary

The regex that I chose is in matching an email. The regex syntax for matching an email is â€“ 

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

During this tutorial I will break down this regex to help understand what it is used for and what each portion fo the expression does.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The anchors for the regex to match and email are. Beginning ^ and the expression is closed with a $ sign. The purpose of the ^ and the $ is to enclose the expression and not allow for partial matches. In this instance , this regex is only looking for an exact match of an email based on the regex sequence that identifies the pattern associated with the email address.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers indicate how many times a patter is matched. In this specific example: 

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ 

There are few quantifiers here,

1. The (+) plus symbol - This is used to indicated that all patterns that preceed this symbol one or more times.
2. The ( {} ) the curly brackets - This sets a limit to the match. This is at the end of the expression with the numbers {2,6} this indicates that the preceeding string matched a min of 2 and a max of 6 times.


### Character Classes

The character classes used in this regex expression are: 
 ( \d )  which equates to numerical digit 0-9.
 ( . ) period, which is the wildcard character that excepts any character except for \n.


### Grouping 

Grouping is indicated by the use of () in this example there are three instances of () being used.

([a-z0-9_\.-]+)

([\da-z\.-]+)

([a-z\.]{2,6})

Take note that that these groups are essential to destablish formatting. For example my email address. jennilee.messenger@gmail.com. Would be broken down as follows using the grouping to identify the information within the formatted email address.

([a-z0-9_\.-]+) jennilee.messenger

@

([\da-z\.-]+) gmail 

.

([a-z\.]{2,6}) com


### Bracket Expressions

There are three bracket expressions within the regex example being given. These brackets enclose the characters that are to be matched.

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ 

[a-z0-9_\.-]  -  indicates any letters a-z and any digits 0-9 excepted an unlimited number of times.
[\da-z\.-] - indicates any digit and a-z
[a-z\.] -  indicateds any character a-z
